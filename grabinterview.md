Problem solving + coding in Golang – next round
o You'll face algorithmic and real-world coding problems in Go.
o Expect a strong focus on problem-solving under constraints, debugging,
and optimizing code.
Topics to Prepare:
o Arrays, strings, maps, recursion, sorting
o Concurrency patterns in Go
o Time/space complexity analysis

Tip:
Brush up on –
• Basic syntax and working of goroutines
• Usage of mutex
• How and where to close the channels and about waitgroup

1. basics of Goroutine
- channel
- mutex
- waitgroup
2. One of the question was increasing memory space in app/website. How do you continuously increase the memory?

3. Related to given 2 log file of timestamp, customer ID and page ID
- Solve to get a list of loyal customer who visit 2 days and 2 unique page id
Advance question if you can solve the first 1: 
- What other approach can it be solve if there is a need to scale for more than 2 days

Transaction Initiation: A participant initiates a transaction (e.g., sending cryptocurrency, recording data).

Broadcast: The transaction is broadcast to the network.

Validation: Network participants (nodes/miners) validate the transaction based on the network's rules (consensus mechanism).

Block Creation: Validated transactions are grouped into a "block."

Hashing & Linking: A cryptographic hash of the new block is generated, which includes the hash of the previous block, creating the "chain."

Addition to Chain: The new block is added to the existing blockchain.

Distribution: The updated ledger (with the new block) is distributed to all participants.
